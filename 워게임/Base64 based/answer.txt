ZmxhZy5waHA= is the base64-encoded message of 'flag.php', and inserting %20 within the message allows for inserting 'flag.php' while bypassing the filter. This is possible because base64_decode() ignores any space character, whereas stripos() only looks for contiguous sequence of the specified pattern.
